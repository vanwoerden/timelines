# Keyboard Shortcuts

This document lists all available keyboard shortcuts for the Timeline Editor application.

## Navigation

## Creation

### **N**
Create a new block to the right of the block furthest to the right. If no blocks exist, creates a block at day 0, row 0.

### **A**
Create a new annotation at the currently selected block's position (date and row). The annotation will be created and immediately enter edit mode.

## Editing

- Most shortcuts require a block or annotation to be selected first
- The **ENTER** key works normally in input fields for submitting text
- The **Escape** key works normally in input fields for canceling edits
